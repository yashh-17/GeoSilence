# AutoSilence
This is an Android Application, it switches phone ringer modes(VIBRATE, SILENT, NORMAL) based on the user preferred geo-location and time.

## Before you build
Please add Google map API key to the gradle.properties file before you build the project

#### Update: This project was a try to implement the feature which would change sound preferences based on user location. But the latest android system gives minimum access to user location and has too many restriction on use of location in background. Now developers are encouraged to use recognition transition api to do similar action, so another project using new technology comes soon. (Android 11 developer preview which gives an option from system settings to change sound profile when user reaches specific location)

## Note: This project would no longer be maintained.
